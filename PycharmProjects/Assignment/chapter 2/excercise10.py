#(Arithmetic, Smallest and Largest) Write a script that inputs three integers from
#the user. Display the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of the numbers. Note that
#each of these is a reduction in functional-style programming.

number1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
number3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))


if number1 < number2 and number1 < number3;
	print(number1,"is the smallest")
if number2 < number1 and number2 < number3:
	print(number2,"is the smallest")
if number3 < number1 and number3 < number2:
	print (number3,"is the smallest")

    
if number1 > number2 and number1 > number3:
    print(number1,"is the largest")
if number2 > number1 and number2 > number3:
    print(number2, "is the largest")
if number3 > number1 and number3 > number2:
    print (number3,"is the largest")
